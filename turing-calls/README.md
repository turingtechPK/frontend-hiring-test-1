# Frontend Hiring Test - Solution

This is my attempt at the Frontend Hiring Test. The only requirement to run this is [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

## Instructions
1. Install pnpm
2. Clone this repo: `git clone `
3. cd into the turing-calls directory: `cd turing-calls`
4. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
5. Run `pnpm dev` to run the application in dev mode, or `pnpm build && pnpm preview` to run it in prod mode
